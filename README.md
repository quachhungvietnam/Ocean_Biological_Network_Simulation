# Ocean Biological Network Simulation

This project aims to apply compuational tools (network, simulation,...) to mimic oceanography biological system. Our simulation allows us to predict system's dynamics in the given scenario (such as spring blooms). 
The first task of this project is to replicate this paper: https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF00392763.pdf 
This is practice exercise to see whether this project is feasible or not.
