# Ocean Biological Network Simulation

<p> This project aims to apply compuational tools (network, simulation,...) to mimic oceanography biological system. Our simulation allows us to predict system's dynamics in the given scenario (such as spring blooms). </p>

## STEP 0: TOY MODEL

## STEP 1: REPLICATE PAPER
The first task of this project is to replicate this paper: https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF00392763.pdf 
The tasks in this step: 
- Adjust the network (from the toy model) to represent the reservoirs and fluxes from the paper
- Find a way to add the parameters of the paper to the network
- Simulate the network and visualize the results (similar to the graphs from the paper)

## STEP 2: ADJUST THE PARAMETERS OF THE MODEL
