# Ocean Biological Network Simulation

<p> This project aims to apply compuational tools (network, simulation,...) to mimic oceanography biological system. Our simulation allows us to predict system's dynamics in the given scenario (such as spring blooms). </p>

The first task of this project is to replicate this paper: https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF00392763.pdf 
This is practice exercise to see whether this project is feasible or not.
